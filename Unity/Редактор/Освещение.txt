Делится на realtime и предварительно_вычисленное

**Realtime lighting**
By default, lights in Unity - directional, spot and point, are realtime — update every frame.
Note that shadows are completely black as there is no bounced light

**Baked lightmaps**

Left: A simple lightmapped scene. Right: The lightmap texture generated by Unity. Note how both shadow and light information is captured.

**Precomputed realtime global illumination**
good example of this would be a time of day system - where the position and color of the light source changes over time
