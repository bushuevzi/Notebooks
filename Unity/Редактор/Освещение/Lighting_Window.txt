Window > Lighting > Settings control point for Unity’s Global Illumination 

	The **Scene** tab settings apply to the overall Scene rather than individual GameObjects. These settings control lighting effects and also optimisation options.
	The **Global maps** tab shows all of the lightmap Asset files generated by the GI lighting process.
	The **Object maps** tab shows previews of GI lightmap textures (including shadow masks) for the currently selected GameObject.
