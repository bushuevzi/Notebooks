====== 4.Load data from fixtures ======
Created Пятница 07 Октябрь 2016

**python manage.py loaddata mydata.json**

Django will search in three locations for fixtures:
	In the fixtures directory of every installed application
	In any directory named in the FIXTURE_DIRS setting
	In the literal path named by the fixture


**python manage.py loaddata foo/bar/mydata.json**
would search **<app_label>/fixtures/foo/bar/mydata.json** for each installed application, **<dirname>/foo/bar/mydata.json** for each directory in **FIXTURE_DIRS**, and the literal path **foo/bar/mydata.json.**


===== The dumpdata command can be used to generate input for loaddata. =====
