====== 5. Making Changes to a Database Schema ======
Created Вторник 20 Сентябрь 2016

* Django will complain loudly if a model contains a field that has not yet been created in the database
table. This will cause an error the first time you use the Django database API to query the given table
(i.e., it will happen at code execution time, not at compilation time).
* Django does not care if a database table contains columns that are not defined in the model.
* Django does not care if a database contains a table that is not represented by a model.


1. Add the field to your model.
2. Run **manage.py makemigrations [yourapp] **
3. Run** manage.py migrate [yourapp] **
4. (Optional.) Launch the Python interactive shell with manage.py shell and verify that the new
field was added properly by importing the model and selecting from the table (e.g.,
MyModel.objects.all()[:5]).
