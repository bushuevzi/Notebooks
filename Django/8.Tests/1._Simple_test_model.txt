**python manage.py test polls**
output:
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
What happened is this:

* **python manage.py test polls** looked for tests in the **polls** application
* it found a subclass of the **django.test.TestCase** class
* it created a special database for the purpose of testing
* it looked for test methods - ones whose names begin with **test**
* in **test_was_published_recently_with_future_question** it created a **Question** instance whose pub_date field is 30 days in the future
* ... and using the **assertIs()** method, it discovered that its **was_published_recently()** returns **True**, though we wanted it to return **False**

The test informs us which test failed and even the line on which the failure occurred.
