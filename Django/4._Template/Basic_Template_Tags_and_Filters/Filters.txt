examples:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
This displays the value of the {{./pasted_image001.png}} variable after being filtered through the //lower// filter, which converts text to lowercase. Use a pipe (|) to apply a filter.


Escaping text contents, and then converting line breaks to <p> tags:
{{./pasted_image002.png}}

* //addslashes//: Adds a backslash before any backslash, single quote, or double quote. This is useful if the produced text is included in a JavaScript string.
* //date//: Formats a //date// or //datetime// object according to a format string given in the parameter, for example:
{{./pasted_image003.png}}
* //escape//: Escapes ampersands, quotes, and angle brackets in the given string. This is useful for
sanitizing user-submitted data and for ensuring data is valid XML or XHTML. Specifically, //escape//
makes these conversions:
	♦ Converts & to &amp;
	♦ Converts < to &lt;
	♦ Converts > to &gt;
	♦ Converts " (double quote) to &quot;
	♦ Converts ' (single quote) to &#39;
* //length//: Returns the length of the value. You can use this on a list or a string, or any Python object
that knows how to determine its length (i.e., any object that has a __len__() method).
