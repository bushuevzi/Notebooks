====== if else ======
Created Воскресенье 11 Сентябрь 2016

The {% if %} tag evaluates a variable, and if that variable is “true” (i.e., it exists, is not empty, and is not a false Boolean value), the system will display everything between {% if %} and {% endif %}, for example:
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
==========================================================================================

{{./pasted_image002.png}}

The use of parentheses for controlling order of operations is not supported. If you find yourself needing
parentheses, consider performing logic in the view code in order to simplify the templates. Even so, if you
need to combine and and or to do advanced logic, just use nested {% if %} tags.
**invalid:**
{% if athlete_list and coach_list or cheerleader_list %}
Multiple uses of the same logical operator are fine, but you can’t combine different operators. For example,
this is **valid**:
{% if athlete_list or coach_list or parent_list or teacher_list %}
