====== modificete metod of model ======
Created Вторник 11 Октябрь 2016

You can click on the column headers to sort by those values – except in the case of the **was_published_recently** header, because sorting by the output of an arbitrary method is not supported. Also note that the column header for **was_published_recently** is, by default, the name of the method (with underscores replaced with spaces), and that each line contains the string representation of the output.

You can improve that by giving that method (in **polls/models.py**) a few attributes, as follows:
