**P<question_id> **— mark. Folowing after this, is a paramert (argumetn) for view function(**[0-9]+**)


When somebody requests a page from your website – say, “/polls/34/”, Django will load the **mysite.urls** Python module because it’s pointed to by the **ROOT_URLCONF** setting. It finds the variable named **urlpatterns** and traverses the regular expressions in order. After finding the match at '**^polls/**', it strips off the matching text ("**polls/**") and sends the remaining text – "**34/**" – to the ‘polls.urls’ URLconf for further processing. There it matches **r'^(?P<question_id>[0-9]+)/$'**, resulting in a call to the **detail()** view like so:

**detail(request=<HttpRequest object>, question_id='34')**

The **question_id='34'** part comes from **(?P<question_id>[0-9]+)**. Using parentheses around a pattern “captures” the text matched by that pattern and sends it as an argument to the view function; **?P<question_id>** defines the name that will be used to identify the matched pattern; and **[0-9]+** is a regular expression to match a sequence of digits (i.e., a number).
