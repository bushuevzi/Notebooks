====== 2. Bayes’s Theorem ======
Created Четверг 16 Март 2017

One of the data scientist’s best friends is Bayes’s Theorem, which is a way of “revers‐
ing” conditional probabilities. Let’s say we need to know the probability of some event
E conditional on some other event F occurring. But we only have information about
the probability of F conditional on E occurring.
