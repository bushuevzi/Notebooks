Then create a **Mat** object that will store the data of the loaded image.
Now we call the **imread** function which loads the image name specified by the first argument (argv[1]). The second argument specifies the format in what we want the image. This may be:
	IMREAD_UNCHANGED (<0) loads the image as is (including the alpha channel if present)
	IMREAD_GRAYSCALE ( 0) loads the image as an intensity one
	IMREAD_COLOR (>0) loads the image in the RGB format

**namedWindow** function. These are automatically managed by OpenCV once you create them. For this you need to specify its name and how it should handle the change of the image it contains from a size point of view. It may be:
	WINDOW_AUTOSIZE is the only supported one if you do not use the Qt backend. In this case the window size will take up the size of the image it shows. No resize permitted!
	WINDOW_NORMAL on Qt you may use this to allow window resize. The image will resize itself according to the current window size. By using the | operator you also need to specify if you would like the image to keep its aspect ratio (WINDOW_KEEPRATIO) or not (WINDOW_FREERATIO).
