====== Load, Modify, and Save an Image ======
Created пятница 10 Ноябрь 2017

	Load an image using **imread**
	Transform an image from BGR to Grayscale format by using **cvtColor**
	Save your transformed image in a file on disk (using **imwrite**)

{{.\pasted_image.png}}
**cvtColor( image, gray_image, COLOR_BGR2GRAY );**
**cvtColor** takes as arguments:
	a source image (image)
	a destination image (gray_image), in which we will save the converted image.
	an additional parameter that indicates what kind of transformation will be performed. In this case we use COLOR_BGR2GRAY (because of imread has BGR default channel order in case of color images).
