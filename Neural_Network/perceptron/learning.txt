Next, we extract the first 100 class labels that correspond to the 50 Iris-Setosa and 50
Iris-Versicolor flowers, respectively, and convert the class labels into the two integer
class labels 1 (Versicolor) and -1 (Setosa) that we assign to a vector y where the values
method of a pandas DataFrame yields the corresponding NumPy representation.
Similarly, we extract the first feature column (sepal length) and the third feature
column (petal length) of those 100 training samples and assign them to a feature
matrix X , which we can visualize via a two-dimensional scatter plot:

Now it's time to train our perceptron algorithm on the Iris data subset that we just
extracted. Also, we will plot the misclassification error for each epoch to check
if the algorithm converged and found a decision boundary that separates the two Iris
flower classes:

Visualise Dessision regions:

As we can see in the preceding plot, the perceptron learned a decision boundary that
was able to classify all flower samples in the Iris training subset perfectly.
