{{./pasted_image.png}}When using a linked style for a Run object, you will need to add 'Char' to the end of its name. For example, to set the Quote linked style for a Paragraph object, you would use **paragraphObj.style = 'Quote'** , but for a Run object, you would use **runObj.style = 'QuoteChar'**
