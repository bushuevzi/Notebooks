====== Simple HTTP server Creating a Simple REST-Based Interface ======
Created Четверг 08 Декабрь 2016

**Problem**
You want to be able to control or interact with your program remotely over the network
using a simple REST-based interface. However, you don’t want to do it by installing a
full-fledged web programming framework.
**Solution**
One of the easiest ways to build REST-based interfaces is to create a tiny library based
on the WSGI standard, as described in PEP 3333. Here is an example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
{{./pasted_image001.png}}

The environ argument is a dictionary that contains values inspired by the CGI interface
provided by various web servers such as Apache
