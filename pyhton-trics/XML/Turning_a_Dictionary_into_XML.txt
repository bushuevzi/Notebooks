====== Turning a Dictionary into XML ======
Created Воскресенье 04 Декабрь 2016

**Problem**
You want to take the data in a Python dictionary and turn it into XML.
**Solution**
Although the xml.etree.ElementTree library is commonly used for parsing, it can also be used to create XML documents. For example, consider this function:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
If the order of the elements matters, consider making an **OrderedDict** instead of a normal dictionary
