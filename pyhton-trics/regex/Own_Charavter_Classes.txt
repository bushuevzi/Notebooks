====== Own Charavter Classes ======
Created Понедельник 27 Июнь 2016

You can define your own character class using square brackets. For example, the character class [aeiouAEIOU].

>>> vowelRegex = re.compile(r'[aeiouAEIOU]')
>>> vowelRegex.findall('RoboCop eats baby food. BABY FOOD.')
['o', 'o', 'o', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'o', 'o', 'A', 'O', 'O']

You can also include ranges of letters or numbers by using a hyphen. For example, the character class [a-zA-Z0-9] will match all lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers. You do not need to escape the . , * , ? , or () characters with a preceding backslash

By placing a caret character ( ^ ) just after the character class’s opening bracket, you can make a negative character class. A negative character class will match all the characters that are not in the character class.
