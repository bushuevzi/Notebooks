====== Defining Generator Functions with Extra State ======
Created Воскресенье 27 Ноябрь 2016

If you want a generator to expose extra state to the user, don’t forget that you can easily implement it as a class, putting the generator function code in the **__iter__()** method. For example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
To use this class, you would treat it like a normal generator function. However, since it creates an instance, you can access internal attributes, such as the history attribute or the clear() method. For example:
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
