====== Bypassing Filename Encoding ======
Created Четверг 01 Декабрь 2016
**Problem**
You want to perform file I/O operations using raw filenames that have not been decoded or encoded according to the default filename encoding.

**Solution**
By default, all filenames are encoded and decoded according to the text encoding returned by **sys.getfilesystemencoding() .** For example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}

{{./pasted_image001.png}}
{{./pasted_image003.png}}
{{./pasted_image004.png}}
