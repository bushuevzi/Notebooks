====== Printing with a Different Separator or Line Ending ======
Created Вторник 29 Ноябрь 2016

**Problem**
You want to output data using print() , but you also want to change the separator character or line ending.
**Solution**
Use the **sep** and **end** keyword arguments to **print()** to change the output as you wish.
For example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
