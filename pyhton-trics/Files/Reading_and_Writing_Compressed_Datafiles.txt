====== Reading and Writing Compressed Datafiles ======
Created Среда 30 Ноябрь 2016

__This allows the gzip and bz2 modules to work with various file-like objects such as sockets, pipes, and in-memory files.__

**Problem**
You need to read or write data in a file with gzip or bz2 compression.

**Solution**
The **gzip** and **bz2** modules make it easy to work with such files. Both modules provide an alternative implementation of **open()** that can be used for this purpose. For example, to read compressed files as text, do this:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
Similarly, to write compressed data, do this:
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
