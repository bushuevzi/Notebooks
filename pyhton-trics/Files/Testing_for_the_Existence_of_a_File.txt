====== Testing for the Existence of a File ======
Created Среда 30 Ноябрь 2016

**Problem**
You need to test whether or not a file or directory exists.
**Solution**
Use the **os.path** module to test for the existence of a file or directory. For example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
You can perform further tests to see what kind of file it might be. These tests return False if the file in question doesn’t exist:
{{./pasted_image001.png}}

If you need to get metadata (e.g., the file size or modification date), that is also available in the os.path module
{{./pasted_image002.png}}
