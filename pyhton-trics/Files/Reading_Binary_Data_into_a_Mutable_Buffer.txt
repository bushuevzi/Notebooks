====== Reading Binary Data into a Mutable Buffer ======
Created Среда 30 Ноябрь 2016

**Problem**
You want to read binary data directly into a mutable buffer without any intermediate copying. Perhaps you want to mutate the data in-place and write it back out to a file.
**Solution**
To read data into a mutable array, use the readinto() method of files. For example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
