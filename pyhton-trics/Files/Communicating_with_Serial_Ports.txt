====== Communicating with Serial Ports ======
Created Четверг 01 Декабрь 2016

**Problem**
You want to read and write data over a serial port, typically to interact with some kind of hardware device (e.g., a robot or sensor).
**Solution**
Although you can probably do this directly using Python’s built-in I/O primitives, your best bet for serial communication is to use the pySerial package. Getting started with the package is very easy. You simply open up a serial port using code like this:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
Once open, you can read and write data using **read() , readline() , **and** write()** calls. For example:
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
Keep in mind that all I/O involving serial ports is binary (or perform proper text encoding/decoding)
