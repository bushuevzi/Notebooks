====== Serializing Python Objects ======
Created Четверг 01 Декабрь 2016

**Problem**
You need to serialize a Python object into a byte stream so that you can do things such as save it to a file, store it in a database, or transmit it over a network connection.
**Solution**
The most common approach for serializing data is to use the **pickle** module. To dump an object to a file, you do this:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
To dump an object to a string, use pickle.dumps() :
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
To re-create an object from a byte stream, use either the **pickle.load()** or **pickle.loads()** functions. For example:
{{./pasted_image002.png}}
