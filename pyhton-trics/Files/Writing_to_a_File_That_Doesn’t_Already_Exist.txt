====== Writing to a File That Doesn’t Already Exist ======
Created Вторник 29 Ноябрь 2016

**Problem**
You want to write data to a file, but only if it doesn’t already exist on the filesystem.
**Solution**
This problem is easily solved by using the little-known **x** mode to **open()** instead of the usual **w** mode. For example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}

{{./pasted_image001.png}}
