====== Reading and Writing Binary Arrays of Structures ======
Created Воскресенье 04 Декабрь 2016

**Problem**
You want to read or write data encoded as a binary array of uniform structures into Python tuples.
**Solution**
To work with binary data, use the **struct** module. Here is an example of code that writes a list of Python tuples out to a binary file, encoding each tuple as a structure using **struct** :

Structures are always defined using a set of structure codes such as i , d , f , and so forth [see the Python documentation]. These codes correspond to specific binary data types such as 32-bit integers, 64-bit floats, 32-bit floats, and so forth. The < in the first character specifies the byte ordering. In this example, it is indicating “little endian.” Change the character to > for big endian or ! for network byte order.
