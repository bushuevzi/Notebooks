The format() function can also be used to easily align things. All you need to do is use the < , > , or ^ characters along with a desired width. For example:
{{./pasted_image002.png}}
If you want to include a fill character other than a space, specify it before the alignment character:
{{./pasted_image003.png}}
{{./pasted_image004.png}}

These format codes can also be used in the format() method when formatting multiple values. For example:
{{./pasted_image005.png}}

One benefit of format() is that it is not specific to strings. It works with any value, making it more general purpose. For instance, you can use it with numbers:
{{./pasted_image006.png}}
