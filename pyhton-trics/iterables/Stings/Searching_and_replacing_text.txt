====== Searching and replacing text ======
Created Среда 23 Ноябрь 2016

For simple literal patterns, use the str.replace() method. For example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
For more complicated patterns, use the sub() functions/methods in the re module. To illustrate, suppose you want to rewrite dates of the form “11/27/2012” as “2012-11-27.” Here is a sample of how to do it:
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
{{./pasted_image003.png}}
The first argument to **sub()** is the pattern to match and the second argument is the replacement pattern. Backslashed digits such as **\3** refer to capture group numbers in the pattern.
