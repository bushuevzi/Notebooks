====== Flattening a Nested Sequence ======
Created Понедельник 28 Ноябрь 2016

**Problem**
You have a nested sequence that you want to flatten into a single list of values.
**Solution**
This is easily solved by writing a recursive generator function involving a yield from statement. For example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
