====== Delegating Iteration ======
Created Воскресенье 27 Ноябрь 2016

**Problem**
You have built a custom container object that internally holds a list, tuple, or some other iterable. You would like to make iteration work with your new container.
**Solution**
Typically, all you need to do is define an **__iter__()** method that delegates iteration to the internally held container. For example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
