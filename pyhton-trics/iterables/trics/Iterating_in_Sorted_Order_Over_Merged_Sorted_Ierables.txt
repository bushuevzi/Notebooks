====== Iterating in Sorted Order Over Merged Sorted Ierables ======
Created Понедельник 28 Ноябрь 2016
**Problem**
You have a collection of sorted sequences and you want to iterate over a sorted sequence of them all merged together.
**Solution**
The **heapq.merge()** function does exactly what you want. For example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}

{{./pasted_image001.png}}
