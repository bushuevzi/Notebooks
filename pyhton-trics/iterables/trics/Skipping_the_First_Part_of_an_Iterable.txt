====== Skipping the First Part of an Iterable ======
Created Воскресенье 27 Ноябрь 2016
**Problem**
You want to iterate over items in an iterable, but the first few items aren’t of interest and you just want to discard them.
**Solution**
The itertools module has a few functions that can be used to address this task. The first is the itertools.dropwhile() function. To use it, you supply a function and an iterable. The returned iterator discards the first items in the sequence as long as the supplied function returns True . Afterward, the entirety of the sequence is produced.
