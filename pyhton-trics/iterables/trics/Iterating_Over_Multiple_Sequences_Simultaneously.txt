====== Iterating Over Multiple Sequences Simultaneously ======
Created Понедельник 28 Ноябрь 2016

**Problem**
You want to iterate over the items contained in more than one sequence at a time.
**Solution**
To iterate over more than one sequence simultaneously, use the **zip()** function. For example:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
**zip(a, b)** works by creating an iterator that produces tuples **(x, y)** where **x** is taken from **a** and **y** is taken from **b** . Iteration stops whenever one of the input sequences is exhausted. Thus, the length of the iteration is the same as the length of the shortest input.
__If this behavior is not desired, use i__**tertools.zip_longest()**__ instead. For example:__
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
