Size Limits
If your search matches a large number of email messages, Python might raise an exception that says imaplib.error: got more than 10000 bytes. When this happens, you will have to disconnect and reconnect to the IMAP server and try again.
This limit is in place to prevent your Python programs from eating up too much memory. Unfortunately, the default size limit is often too small.
You can change this limit from 10,000 bytes to 10,000,000 bytes by running this code:

>>> import imaplib
>>> imaplib._MAXLINE = 10000000
